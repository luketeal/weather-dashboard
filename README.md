# weather-dashboard

This is [a aimple weather app](https://luketeal.github.io/weather-dashboard/).  

The project uses HTML and JS as a codebase. 
The project utilizes Bootstrap, JQuery, DayJS, and OpenWeather API's.

## Objectives

The web app presents the user with an option to search for a city and will present the user with the current weather and the five day forecast.  The website will store the user's search history in local storage and display them to the user as buttons for future searches.

## Instructions

1. Input a city into the search box and select search (note that it may take a second or two to populate all the data).
    * The user will be presented with the current weather (note that the date for the current day is in the header of the web page) as well as the five day forecast.
2. The user may press one of the buttons in the search history to search that location again.
